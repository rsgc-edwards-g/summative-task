# Summative Task

## Overall goal

My summative task will be a 3-Dimensional representation of the concept of gravity and its effects in physics.

I will code a simulation of gravity's effects on space-time as well as light. Each of my simulations will show these effects from the perspective of an omnipotent observer looking at 2-D space-time as well as an observer in space-time.

To show these multiple perspectives, I will be using Processing's 3-Dimensional transformations. 

In my simulations, I intend to show gravity's effect on light itself through gravitational lensing, gravity's effects on orbits and gravity's contributions to the compression of the core of a dying star.

## Sub-goals

* research Processing's P3D rendering functions
* create an accurate depiction of 2-D space-time for simulations
* accurately represent gravity's effects on space-time and celestial objects
* represent forces with vectors in simulations
* make my simulations interactive by adding a way for a user to change masses of objects (objects will have radii but their mass will be treated as entirely at their centers)
* track the motions and states of objects as simulations progress, including telling the user when the simulation is completed
